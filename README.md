## Hi Everyone! 

About Me

I’m a Data Scientist on the lookout for opportunities to deepen my expertise in data science and visualization while contributing to fun and innovative projects.

Working with raw data and transforming it into engaging visualizations is my passion. I’ve always enjoyed analyzing charts in the news and media, so it’s incredible to say, “This is what I do for a living!” I love creating clear, informative visuals to uncover insights and determine what comes next.

I’m a helper, problem solver, and analyzer who loves brainstorming and tackling challenges. Whether it’s coming up with creative solutions or supporting my team with thoughtful advice, I’m known for being a reliable and collaborative colleague.

Technical Skills:


Programming Languages: SQL, Python, R
Data Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
Visualization Tools: Tableau, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn
Big Data Technologies: AWS, Hadoop, Spark, Hive
Tools: Git, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, Visual Studio Code, Markdown

I’m currently working on ...

When I’m outside the data world, you’ll find me exploring new recipes, working out, painting, or diving into a good book! Cooking is a particular joy for me, as I love discovering new dishes to share with friends and family.

I’m always open to networking and participating in opportunities to expand my portfolio and experience in Data Science and Data Analytics. Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn!
