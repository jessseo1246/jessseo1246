## üòÄ About Me

I‚Äôm a Data Scientist with a passion for predictive analytics and creating engaging visualizations. I‚Äôve always enjoyed analyzing charts in the news and media, so it‚Äôs incredible to say, ‚ÄúThis is what I do for a living!‚Äù I love creating clear, informative visuals to uncover insights and determine what comes next. Currently, I‚Äôm deepening my expertise in data science with a focus on predictive analytics in innovative projects. 

In addition to my technical skills, I‚Äôm a helper, problem solver, and analyzer who loves brainstorming and tackling challenges. Whether it‚Äôs coming up with creative solutions or supporting my team with thoughtful advice, I‚Äôm known for being a reliable and collaborative colleague.

## üß© Projects

**[Forecasting TTC Streetcar Delay](https://github.com/jessseo1246/Forecasting_TTC_Streetcar_Delays)** | _Nov 2023_

Many people rely on public transportation as their primary means of travel. When public transit experiences unexpected delays or cancellations, it disrupts passengers' schedules and raises safety concerns. This project analyzes Toronto's streetcar delays and their causes to identify delay patterns. The goal is to help commuters predict the severity of delays based on time, streetcar route, and weather.
