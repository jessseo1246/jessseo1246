## üòÄ About Me

I‚Äôm a Data Scientist with a passion for working with raw data and transforming it into engaging visualizations. I‚Äôve always enjoyed analyzing charts in the news and media, so it‚Äôs incredible to say, ‚ÄúThis is what I do for a living!‚Äù I love creating clear, informative visuals to uncover insights and determine what comes next. Currently, I‚Äôm deepening my expertise in data science with a focus on predictive analytics, applying my skills and knowledge to drive innovative projects. 

In addition to my technical skills, I‚Äôm a helper, problem solver, and analyzer who loves brainstorming and tackling challenges. Whether it‚Äôs coming up with creative solutions or supporting my team with thoughtful advice, I‚Äôm known for being a reliable and collaborative colleague.
